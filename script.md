“Smash Panel” exposes a manual actuator relay (mechanical cycling access) even if the interface locks

# SCENE 1: THE AWAKENING (00:00 – 02:30)
(Visual: Pitch black. A low, throbbing bass sound, like a cello played with a rusted saw, fills the audio. It is uncomfortable.)

Narrator: The world didn't end with a bang. It didn't end with a whimper. It ended with a hum.

Narrator: It started at the Global Research Hub. They called it "The Bridge", a neural patch designed to synchronize human thought. It was supposed to end loneliness. It was supposed to let us understand each other perfectly. Instead, it ended individuality.

(Visual: Fade in. A distorted, glitching view of a purple sky. Teal lightning arcs silently. Below, thousands of people stand frozen in a field, staring up at the clouds.)

Narrator: They call it THE DESYNC. A resonance cascade. A neurological glitch that tells your brain your body no longer belongs to you. Outside, the "Standing People" wait. Their minds are uploaded to a digital heaven. Their bodies are rotting in the rain.

(Visual: Far on the horizon, a jagged transmission tower pulses teal, regular, rhythmic, like a lighthouse in reverse.)

Narrator: This bunker sits on the last hardline junction. If it falls, the signal jumps the repeater and takes the rest of the coastline.

(Visual: A Tactical HUD flickers to life. It is messy. Red text scrolls rapidly, overlapping itself.)
Xena (Internal): System Reboot... Neural Latency: 32ms... Visual Clarity: 68%.

Xena (Internal): I can feel it. The parasite. It feels like static wool rubbing against the inside of my skull. It’s warm. It’s inviting. It wants me to put down the gun. It wants me to sleep.

Xena (Internal): Focus. Pain is clarity. I am Agent Xena. I am the last firewall. If I don't seal this bunker, the signal jumps the repeater and takes the rest of the coastline.

Xena: "Bunker AI. Status Report."

Bunker AI: "Welcome back, Agent. Final Seal Protocol initiated. 15 minutes remaining until total atmospheric lockout. External sensors detect four biological assets at the airlock."

Bunker AI: "Advisory: Inner Sanctum life support is damaged. It can sustain ONE additional biological signature."

Xena: "Open the outer pane. Let's see who’s left of the world. One of them is the Neuro-Architect. I need to retrieve the key before I... before I forget my own name."
(HUD Overlay: TIME LEFT: 15:00 | LATENCY: 32ms)

# SCENE 2: THE HUB (02:30 – 03:30)
(Visual: The heavy blast doors hiss open. Behind a thick pane of reinforced glass, four people are huddled. The lighting is emergency red. The hum is louder here.)

(Spatial Note: Xena stands in the inner control corridor. The survivors are in the outer airlock chamber behind reinforced glass “the outer pane.” The mist is pressing in from outside.)

Trent (Slamming a heavy wrench against the glass): "Open the damn door! Can’t you see the mist?! It’s eating the seals! I can hear the rubber dissolving!"

Kai (Shoving Trent back by the shoulder): "Stand down, you idiot! You’re going to shatter the integrity of the barrier! Agent! Agent, look at me! I am Kai, North Sector Admin. I have the clearance codes. I am the only asset worth saving!"

(Visual detail: Kai’s fingers twitch, tapping an invisible keyboard—tap-tap-tap—he doesn’t notice.)

Mina (Curled in the corner, clutching her ears, nose bleeding): "440 hertz... no... 432... B-flat... it's a B-flat... please make it stop..."

Lisa (Leaning against the wall, eerily calm, eyes closed): "It won't stop, dear. The second verse is just beginning. Can't you hear the harmony?"

Xena: "Silence! All of you! The Inner Sanctum life support is damaged. It can only sustain ONE additional biological signature. One of you is the Specialist who built this nightmare. Convince me why you should live."

[SYSTEM NOTE: The Player is now in the 'Hub'. They can click any character. Each interrogation consumes 2 minutes of game time. Turning Point triggers automatically when TIME LEFT reaches 07:30.]

# SCENE 3: THE DEEP INTERROGATIONS (03:30 – 10:00)

## OPTION A: KAI (The Seductive Logic)

Kai: "Agent, use your eyes. Look at this selection. A mechanic shouting at glass like an animal. A singer lost in a fantasy. And a girl bleeding from her nose, already half-Desynced."

Xena: "The girl is the suspected Architect. She has the technical knowledge."

Kai: "The girl is unstable! Look at her tremors. She's unresponsive. You’re going to bet the fate of the human race, and your own life, on someone who can’t even stand up? I ran the North Sector. I held the line for six hours longer than anyone else."

(Visual/Action: Kai presses his clearance chip to a scanner panel on the airlock frame.)

Bunker AI: "North Sector credentials recognized. Limited administrative interface granted."

(Visual: A small system interface briefly opens: menus, logs, toggles, then a violent waveform overlay ignores it.)

Bunker AI: "Advisory: Resonance carrier does not route through standard network security layers."

[CHOICE: CHALLENGE vs TRUST]


### 1."Your sector fell in six hours. Your code failed."

Xena: "I saw the reports, Kai. The North Sector fell. If your firewalls were so perfect, why are you the only one standing here?"

Kai (desperate but logical): "It failed because people panicked! They tried to 'feel' the signal! They tried to negotiate with it! I survived because I followed protocol. I isolated the nodes. I cut the hardlines. Protocol saves lives, Xena. Emotion gets you killed. I can write a script to mask this bunker right now. I am the safe bet."

Xena (Internal): He makes sense. He offers a solution I can understand. But he views the Desync as a bug, not a flood. He’s too rigid. He’s a bureaucrat fighting a god.

(Result: DEDUCTION UP. You realize Kai is a trap.)

### 2."You make a strong case. We need stability."

Xena: "You're right. Mina looks like she's about to snap. I need someone who can type without shaking."

Kai: "Exactly. Pull me in. I’ll erect a firewall that will hide us from the signal forever. Just open the door."
(Result: TRUST UP. You are being misled.)

(HUD Overlay: TIME LEFT updates | LATENCY increases slightly)


## OPTION B: TRENT (The Physical Reality)

Trent: "Are you done chatting with the suit? The gaskets are vibrating, Agent! Can't you feel that in your teeth? That buzzing?"

Xena: "Panic accelerates the Desync, Trent. Stand down and let me think."

Trent: "I'm not panicking, I'm analyzing! I built these doors! Look at the seal. It's liquefying. Software gets hacked, Agent. Steel doesn't. When the lights go out, do you want to be typing on a keyboard, or do you want a mechanical lock that works?"

[CHOICE: INVESTIGATE vs DISMISS]
### 1. "What do you mean by a mechanical lock?"

Xena: "Explain. If the software fails, how do we seal the door?"

Trent: "The terminal inside... it's networked, right? If the AI takes it over, you're locked out. But there's a manual override switch under the primary coolant plate. You have to rip the steel housing off to get to it. I have the wrench. I have the strength. You need me."

Xena (Internal): A physical backdoor. He's crude, but he's right. If the software fails, brute force is my only option.

(Result: HARDWARE CLUE OBTAINED, TRENT TRUST GOES UP.)

(Mechanical clarification: The “coolant plate housing” covers a dumb actuator relay, manual door cycling access. It’s a physical bypass if the interface locks.)

### 2. "Back off the glass. That's an order."

Xena: "You're a maintenance tech, Trent. I need a scientist, not a janitor. Back off."

Trent: "Janitor? I'm the only reason this airlock hasn't decompressed yet! Fine. When that glass breaks, don't come crying to me to fix it. Die with your pristine machine."

(Result: TRENT TRUST DOWN.)

(HUD Overlay: TIME LEFT updates | LATENCY increases slightly)


## OPTION C: LISA (The Lore)

Lisa: "You have the hum too, don't you Xena? I can hear it in your breathing. A low, mournful sound. It's beautiful, in a way."

Xena: "I hear static. System interference. Nothing more. Keep it together, citizen."
Lisa: "No. It's music. Do you know what a B-Flat is, Xena? It's the resonant frequency of the universe. Black holes hum in B-Flat 57 octaves below middle C. The AI isn't trying to kill us, Xena. It thinks it's helping us ascend. It's a choir... but it's singing too loud for our little minds."

Lisa: “I sang to the Core once, during calibration. It sang back.”

(Xena Internal Note: Even if her cosmology is poetry, the pitch part matches Mina.)

[CHOICE: LISTEN vs DISMISS]

### 1. "So how do we survive the song?"

Xena: "If it's a sound, it can be silenced. How?"

Lisa: "You can't silence it. You have to harmonize with it. You need to interrupt the harmony. You don't need a shield. You need a counter-note. A frequency that cancels a B-Flat. Find the note, Xena. Or you're just another instrument."

Xena (Internal): Harmonics. Not code. This matches what the Specialist is whispering. Kai is trying to build a wall; Lisa is telling me how to break the wave.

(Result: FREQUENCY CLUE OBTAINED, LISA TRUST GOES UP)

### 2. "I don't have time for poetry."

Xena: "The world is ending and you're talking about opera. Step back."

Lisa: "Pity. You're listening with your gun, not your ears. You'll die in silence."

(Result: CLUE MISSED, LISA TRUST GOES DOWN)

(HUD Overlay: TIME LEFT updates | LATENCY increases slightly)


## OPTION D: MINA (The Broken Specialist)

Mina: "440 Hertz... no... 432... the bridge is open... they are walking through the bridge into my eyes... I can feel their feet..."

Xena (Internal): She is the Neuro-Architect. She built the Core. But her mind is shattering. She's bleeding from the nose, a sign of advanced signal penetration.

Bunker AI: "Advisory: Subject vocalizations indicate tuning references. Carrier harmonic classification remains B-flat baseline (relative)."

[CHOICE: EMPATHY vs FORCE]

### 1. "Mina. Look at me. Breathe. You built the bridge. You can close it."

Xena (Softly): "Mina. I know it hurts. But you are the Architect. You know where the off switch is. Ignore the sky. Focus on my voice."

Mina (Calming down, weeping): "I... I built it to connect us. I didn't mean for this to happen. I can close it... but I need to hear the end of the song. I need to know the frequency. Can you protect me while I listen?"

(Result: MINA TRUST UP. She stabilizes.)

### 2. "Snap out of it! Give me the code!"

Xena (Shouting): "I don't have time for a breakdown! Give me the override sequence now! What is the code?!"

Mina (Screaming): "I can't! It's too loud! The numbers are bleeding! Get away from me! You sound like them! You sound like the machine!"

(Result: MINA TRUST DOWN. She enters shock.)

(HUD Overlay: TIME LEFT updates | LATENCY increases slightly)





SCENE 4: THE TURNING POINT (10:00 – 11:30)

(Visual: The screen glitches violently. The timer hits 07:30 remaining. The bunker lighting shifts to a sickly, strobing teal. The hum becomes deafening.)

Bunker AI: "WARNING. SIGNAL PENETRATION 45%. SYSTEM LOCKDOWN IMMINENT. NEURAL PROTECTION FAILING."

Bunker AI: "CRITICAL STATE: Final Seal timer is now irreversible. Manual actions no longer delay lockout."

Trent: "The software is locking us out! Look at the panel! It's turning teal! I told you! I'm smashing the panel!" (Trent raises his heavy wrench to smash the exterior control panel.)

Kai: "No! Xena, stop him! He'll destroy the delicate circuits! We need that interface!"

(Spatial/Mechanical note: Trent targets the coolant-plate actuator housing panel- manual relay access-not the main terminal display.)

[CRITICAL CHOICE]

### 1. "Let Trent smash the panel."

Narrator: Trent swings the wrench with a primal scream. Sparks fly. The plastic housing shatters. The digital lock is broken, but the copper wires are exposed to the air.

Narrator: The actuator relay is exposed-> manual cycling is now possible even if the AI locks the interface.

Xena: "Good work. We have manual access."

(Consequence: -1 Minute Time. Hardware Clue FORCE TRUE.)

### 2. "Stop Trent. Protect the hardware."

Narrator: You aim your weapon at Trent's chest. He freezes. He backs off, spitting on the floor.
Trent: "Fine. Die with your pristine machine. But when that door stays shut, remember that you chose this."

(Consequence: The panel is safe, but you are now 100% reliant on Mina’s mental state.)


SCENE 4.1: THE DETERIORATION (11:30 – 13:30)

(Visual: The glitches get worse. Text on the HUD starts rearranging itself. "SAVE HER" turns into "SAVE US". "PROTOCOL" turns into "LET GO".)

Xena (Internal): I turn my head... and the world buffers. The wall is blue. No, the wall is screaming. Focus. Neural Latency: Critical. I need to save... who am I saving? Why am I here?

(Visual/Audio: The Bunker AI voice distorts->two voices overlap: the bunker system and something beneath it.)

Bunker AI: "Xena... it's warm in here. Why are you fighting? The data is beautiful. Just open the helmet."

Xena: "Get out of my head! I am not a file! I am a soldier!"

(Visual: A loud CRACK. The airlock glass fractures. Teal mist->which looks like floating binary code, hisses into the room.)

(Spatial note: The outer pane/outer seal compromise floods the outer airlock chamber->where the survivors are, with teal mist.)

Lisa: "The pitch is rising! It's modulating to C-Sharp! The song is getting angrier!"

Xena: "Helmets on! If you don't have one, hold your breath!"

Narrator: The mist isn't just smoke. It’s data. As it fills the room, you can hear the thoughts of the people outside. Screaming. Laughing. Praying. It's a chorus of a billion ghosts.

Xena (Internal): My suit protects me, but they are exposed. They are fading. Mina is staring at the ceiling. Kai is typing on the air. I have seconds to make the choice.


SCENE 5: THE FINAL SELECTION (13:30 – 14:00)
(Visual: The heavy blast doors begin to grind shut. The hum is deafening. The teal light is blinding.)

Bunker AI: "FINAL SEAL IN 60 SECONDS. SELECT ONE ASSET FOR ENTRY."

Xena: "I can only take one! The rest of you... I'm sorry."

Kai: "You can't leave me! I'm the Admin!" 

Trent: "Take me! I can fix it!" 

Mina: "Please... I don't want to become a statue..."

Bunker AI: "Reminder: Inner Sanctum supports ONE additional biological signature. Multi-entry will trigger oxygen failure."

[FINAL CHOICE MENU - NO GOING BACK]
1. Pull in KAI (The Security Admin)
2. Pull in TRENT (The Mechanic)
3. Pull in LISA (The Singer)
4. Pull in MINA (The Architect)


SCENE 6: THE ENDINGS (14:00 – 15:00)

IF YOU CHOOSE KAI (THE DECOY)

Narrator: The door seals. The screams of the others are cut off instantly.

Xena: "Fix it, Kai! Put up the firewall! We have ten seconds!"

Kai (Typing furiously): "I... I can't stop it! The code is rewriting itself! It's recursive! It's eating my logic!"
Narrator: Kai turns to look at you. His eyes are gone. Replaced by glowing teal sockets. He smiles, but it's not a human smile.

Kai (Voice distorted): "Thank you... for bringing us... inside. It is so clear in here."

Xena: "No... NO!"

Narrator: Your HUD dissolves. The last thing you feel is the cold, digital comfort of the hive mind.

[GAME OVER: THE TROJAN HORSE]


IF YOU CHOOSE TRENT (THE AGGRESSOR)

Narrator: The door seals. Trent drops the wrench and rushes the terminal.

Trent: "Alright, you piece of junk! I'm cutting the power! No power, no signal!"

Narrator: He rips the wires. The screen goes black. The lights die.

Trent: "Ha! Got it! We're safe!"

Bunker AI: "POWER FAILURE DETECTED. MAGNETIC SHIELDING OFFLINE."

Xena: "You idiot! The shields were powered by that circuit!"

Narrator: Without the shield, the Desync floods the room instantly. You don't even have time to scream. You are both statues before you hit the floor.

[GAME OVER: BRUTE FORCE FAILURE]


IF YOU CHOOSE LISA (THE POET)

Narrator: The door seals. Lisa walks calmly to the terminal, touching the screen.

Lisa: "It's too late for machines, Xena."

Xena: "Do something! Sing the note! Save us!"

Lisa: "I can't sing loud enough to drown out god, my dear. I'm just one voice. But I can sing you to sleep."

Narrator: She hums a lullaby as the teal light consumes you. It is peaceful. It is fatal.

[GAME OVER: A QUIET DEATH]


IF YOU CHOOSE MINA (THE SPECIALIST)

Narrator: The blast doors slam shut. You can hear Kai screaming "PROTOCOL!" and Trent cursing your name until the seal is airtight.

Xena: "We're in. Mina, the terminal is yours."

Mina (Shaking, hands hovering over the keys): "I... I can't see the keyboard. My eyes are burning. The song... it's crushing me."

(Branching Check:)
• IF TRUST IS LOW:
Mina: "I'm too scared... I can't do it! Don't look at me!"

(Visual: Mina collapses. Xena watches as Mina's skin turns gray and her eyes glow teal.)


[GAME OVER: FEAR IS THE KILLER]

•IF NO CLUE (B-FLAT):

Mina: "What's the frequency, Xena? I need the counter-note! I need to know what to play!"

Xena: "I... I don't know! Just guess!"

Mina: "I can't guess! There are millions of tones!"
Narrator: She types a random code. It fails. The bridge stays open.

[GAME OVER: THE WRONG SONG]

IF HIGH TRUST + B-FLAT CLUE (TRUE ENDING):

Xena: "It's a B-Flat, Mina! The universe is humming in B-Flat! Invert the frequency!"

Mina: "B-Flat... yes. I hear it. I can see the wave."

Narrator: Mina types the command. She opens her mouth and hums a tone that vibrates in your bones.

Mina: "Sending the counter-resonance... NOW."

(Visual: A massive, bone-shaking thrum. Xena falls to her knees. Mina screams as the energy passes through her body.)

Bunker AI: "Signal terminated. Atmosphere stabilizing. Connection severed."

Bunker AI: “Warning: Neural overload detected in Subject Mina. Permanent synaptic damage likely.”

Xena: "Mina?"

(Visual: Mina is slumped over the console. Her hair has turned stark white from the stress. She looks older.)

Mina: "It’s quiet... Xena... I think I broke the bridge. We’re safe. But we’re stuck here. The door won't open again."

Xena: "Stuck is better than dead."

Narrator: You sit in the dark, listening to the silence. It is the most beautiful sound you have ever heard.

[TRUE ENDING: HUMANITY SAVED]
