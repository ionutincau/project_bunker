## 🏆 ENDING 1: HUMANITY SAVED (True Ending)

**This is the ONLY winning ending where humanity survives.**

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Start the game** and watch the opening sequence
2. **Hub Entry** - Meet all four survivors
3. **Interrogate Lisa** first (costs 2:00)
   - Choose: **"So how do we survive the song?"**
   - Result: You get the B-Flat frequency clue ✓
4. **Interrogate Mina** (costs 2:00)
   - Choose: **"Mina. Look at me. Breathe. You built the bridge. You can close it."**
   - Result: Mina's trust increases ✓
5. **Optional: Interrogate Trent** for extra info
   - Choose: "What do you mean by a mechanical lock?"
   - Result: Hardware clue (backup knowledge)
6. **Optional: Interrogate Kai** to understand the trap
   - Choose either option (Kai won't help regardless)
7. **Turning Point (07:30)** - Trent wants to smash panel
   - Choose: **Either option works** (Let him OR Stop him)
8. **Deterioration Scene** - Glass breaks, teal mist enters
9. **Final Selection (01:00)** - The critical moment
   - Choose: **"Pull in MINA (The Architect)"**
10. **Victory!**
    - Xena tells Mina the frequency is B-Flat
    - Mina inverts the frequency and stops the signal
    - World is saved (but they're stuck in the bunker)
    - Mina's hair turns white from the trauma

**Key Requirements:**
- ✓ frequency_clue = True (from Lisa)
- ✓ mina_trust ≥ 1 (from being kind to Mina)

## 💀 ENDING 2: THE TROJAN HORSE (Bad Ending)

### Quick Path:
1. Skip or talk to anyone (doesn't matter)
2. **Final Selection:** Choose **"Pull in KAI (The Admin)"**

### What Happens:
- Kai tries to create a firewall
- The code is recursive and eats his logic
- Kai's eyes turn glowing teal
- He's been possessed by the Desync
- He thanks you for bringing the virus inside
- Xena gets assimilated into the hive mind
- **Game Over: Humanity falls**

**Why This Fails:** The Desync isn't software - it's a frequency. Kai's approach is wrong.

## ⚡ ENDING 3: BRUTE FORCE FAILURE (Bad Ending)

### Quick Path:
1. Skip or talk to anyone (doesn't matter)
2. **Final Selection:** Choose **"Pull in TRENT (The Mechanic)"**

### What Happens:
- Trent rushes to the terminal
- He cuts all power to stop the signal
- Lights die, everything goes black
- But the magnetic shielding was powered by that circuit!
- Without shields, the Desync floods in instantly
- Both Xena and Trent become statues before hitting the floor
- **Game Over: Humanity falls**

**Why This Fails:** Turning off power kills the shields that were protecting them.

## 🎵 ENDING 4: A QUIET DEATH (Bad Ending)

### Quick Path:
1. Skip or talk to anyone (doesn't matter)
2. **Final Selection:** Choose **"Pull in LISA (The Singer)"**

### What Happens:
- Lisa calmly walks to the terminal
- She tells Xena it's too late for machines
- Lisa explains she can't sing loud enough to drown out "god"
- She hums a peaceful lullaby
- Teal light consumes them both
- They die peacefully
- **Game Over: Humanity falls**

**Why This Fails:** Lisa understands the problem but lacks the technical means to solve it.

## 🎼 ENDING 5: THE WRONG SONG (Tragic Failure)

**Requirements:** Choose Mina BUT miss the frequency clue from Lisa

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Interrogate Mina** - Be kind to her
   - Choose: "Mina. Look at me. Breathe..."
   - Result: mina_trust increases ✓
2. **Either skip Lisa OR dismiss her**
   - If talking to Lisa, choose: "I don't have time for poetry"
   - Result: frequency_clue = False ✗
3. **Final Selection:** Choose **"Pull in MINA"**

### What Happens:
- Mina is ready and willing to help
- She asks: "What's the frequency? I need the counter-note!"
- Xena doesn't know - you didn't get the clue
- Xena tells Mina to guess
- Mina explains there are millions of possible tones
- She tries a random code
- It fails - the bridge stays open
- **Game Over: Humanity falls**

**Why This Fails:** Right person, right trust, but missing critical information.

   - Choose: "So how do we survive the song?"
   - Result: frequency_clue = True ✓
2. **Interrogate Mina** - Be harsh/forceful
   - Choose: **"Snap out of it! Give me the code!"**
   - Result: mina_trust decreases ✗
3. **Final Selection:** Choose **"Pull in MINA"**

### What Happens:
- You've chosen the right person
- You have the frequency information
- But Mina is too terrified and traumatized
- She says: "I'm too scared... I can't do it!"
- She collapses before she can type

## 🧩 The Puzzle Explained

The game is designed as a **deduction + empathy puzzle**:

**Wrong Approaches:**
- Pure logic (Kai) = Fails
- Pure force (Trent) = Fails  
- Pure emotion (Lisa) = Fails

**Correct Approach:**
- Right person (Mina = Architect)
- Right knowledge (B-Flat frequency)
- Right relationship (Trust/empathy)

The game teaches that solving complex problems requires:
1. **Expertise** - The right person for the job
2. **Information** - Critical knowledge
3. **Compassion** - Treating people with kindness
