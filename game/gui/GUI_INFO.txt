GUI IMAGES NEEDED
==================================================

Place these files in this directory:

  - main_menu.png (1920x1080 - Dark sci-fi background)
  - game_menu.png (1920x1080 - Dark background for pause menu)

==================================================

The main_menu_background image has been generated and is
available in the artifacts panel. You can:

1. Download the generated image from artifacts
2. Rename it to "main_menu.png"  
3. Place it in this directory (game/gui/)

For game_menu.png, you can:
- Use the same image as main_menu.png
- Create a slightly darker/blurred version
- Use a simple dark gradient

Ren'Py will use fallback colors if these are missing,
but custom backgrounds greatly enhance the atmosphere.
